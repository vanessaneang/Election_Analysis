# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
Employees from the Colorado Board of Elections need to go over the recent election results to determine how many votes each candidate recieved, the perentage of votes recieved by each candidate, the number of total votes casted, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.


## Election-Audit Results 

* How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

Total votes was found by setting the vote count variable to 0 then for loops were used to add an additional vote to the counter.
